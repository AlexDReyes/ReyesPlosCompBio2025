The two scripts recreat the data and figures in the mansucript.  There are two files: one (ScriptsPlos_sustained_final.m) is for sustained stimulus and recreates Figures 1-5 and the other is for transient stimuli (ScriptsPlos_Transient_final.m) and recreates figure 6  

The codes are written in MATLAB.  Choose a section to run and in the editor tab, push "Run Selection".  If you push "Run", the entire script will run.
